### 5. **Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Issues:**

1. **"JIRA Configuration Required" keeps showing:**
   - Check that your credentials are correct
   - Verify your JIRA server URL is accessible
   - Make sure your API token is valid

2. **"Connection test failed":**
   - Verify your JIRA server URL format: `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`
   - Check that your email and API token are correct
   - Ensure your JIRA account has API access

3. **"Failed to load tasks":**
   - Check your JQL query in the filter
   - Verify you have permission to view the issues
   - Try a simpler query like `assignee = currentUser()`

4. **Plugin not loading:**
   - Check the Obsidian console for errors (Help â†’ Toggle Developer Tools)
   - Ensure the plugin files are in the correct location
   - Try disabling and re-enabling the plugin

#### **Getting Help:**

1. **Check the console:**
   - Open Developer Tools (Help â†’ Toggle Developer Tools)
   - Look for any error messages in the Console tab

2. **Test with a simple JQL query:**
   - Try: `assignee = currentUser()`
   - Or: `project = "YOUR_PROJECT_KEY"`

3. **Verify JIRA API access:**
   - Test your credentials with a simple curl command:
   ```bash
   curl -u your-email@example.com:your-api-token \
        -H "Accept: application/json" \
        https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/myself
   ```

### 6. **Expected Behavior**

#### **First Time Setup:**
1. Plugin shows configuration screen
2. User enters JIRA credentials
3. Connection test succeeds
4. Credentials are saved securely
5. Dashboard loads with user's issues

#### **Subsequent Uses:**
1. Plugin automatically connects using stored credentials
2. Dashboard loads immediately
3. User can view, filter, and group their issues
4. Settings can be accessed to reconfigure if needed

#### **Performance:**
- Initial load: 2-5 seconds (depending on issue count)
- Refresh: 1-3 seconds
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute (handled automatically)
- Caching: Issues cached for 2 minutes

### 7. **Test Data**

The plugin will show real data from your JIRA instance:
- Issues assigned to you
- Issues in projects you have access to
- Real issue details, statuses, and priorities
- Actual user information and avatars

### 8. **Security Notes**

- âœ… Credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- âœ… API tokens are never stored in plain text
- âœ… Master password is used only for encryption/decryption
- âœ… All API calls use HTTPS
- âœ… Rate limiting prevents API abuse
