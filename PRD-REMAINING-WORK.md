## Document Metadata
- **Version**: 2.0.0
- **Date**: 2025-01-26
- **Author**: Caio Niehues with Claude Code
- **Status**: Ready for Implementation
- **Project**: Richemont JIRA-Obsidian Integration Plugin

## Executive Summary
This PRD defines the remaining features and improvements needed to complete the JIRA-Obsidian integration plugin. The foundation is solid with secure authentication, API integration, and basic UI components already implemented. The focus now shifts to Obsidian-specific features, complete configuration management, and advanced JIRA capabilities.

## Current State Analysis
